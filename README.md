# Gato Pic Bot
Originally as a Go practice project, and also a curiosity on how Go Telegram Bot API works, this a fun playground for a bot that just gives you cat pics ðŸ˜„

The `Playground/` folder is just random tests that I played with, `give-me-a-cat.go` gives you a cat in your browser, using the same API tokens. 

## How to run

You'll need: 

- A [Cat API token](https://thecatapi.com/)
- A Telegram Bot API token (from Bot Father in Telegram)

Generate a `.env` file from the template, fill it with the tokens and then use `go run telegram-requests.go`

Have fun! ðŸ˜»
